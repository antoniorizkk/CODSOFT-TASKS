I’ve crafted a personal portfolio that’s as unique as my journey in web development. At the very top, you’ll find my name, proudly sitting alongside a tagline that captures my essence. My ‘About’ section features a snapshot of me, accompanied by a bio that delves into my skills and experiences. I’ve laid out my core competencies in the ‘Skills’ section, while my ‘Projects’ section is a visual narrative of my work, complete with titles, descriptions, and imagery. For those interested in the details, my resume is just a click away in PDF format. And because connection is key, my ‘Contact’ section ensures you can reach me with ease. Finally, the footer carries the mark of my copyright and additional resources. Welcome to my world.

# TASK3 - calculator
I’ve developed a basic yet powerful calculator that’s as functional as it is visually appealing. With an interactive interface complete with buttons for all the essential arithmetic operations, this tool is designed to make calculations seamless. The display screen clearly shows both input and results, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
